<p>Did you know that vintage rotary phones work with modern bluetooth devices? Simply plug the device into your rotary phone (or even a more modern home phone), connect it via bluetooth to your cellphone and soon all of your calls will be coming through the 1950s! <p>

<p> Using a rotary phone adds a bit of mystery to your day. Who is calling? Your cousin, a telemarketer, Frank Sinatra? You have to answer to find out!<p>

<p>Dialing numbers is not only a nice moment to slow down, it also stimulates your mind, and helps you remember the phone numbers of important people in your life.<p>
