<p>While typewriters may seem like ancient technology now, in the world of smart phones and laptops, there are many benefits that come from these machines.<p></p>

<p>Typewriters are distraction free. There are no emails or social media platforms to take your mind away from what you are writing. You can work freely on a novel, or a journal entry, or poem, or even a grocery list, without any distractions.<p>

<p>Typewriters are also used as ways of creating art pieces with their large variety of fonts, and refurbishing them themselves is an exciting and interesting experience.<p>

<p>But where does one begin? Where do you find a typewriter? And what do you do once you receive it?<p>
